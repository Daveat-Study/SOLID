# SOLID
SOLID Design Pattern

# Main Concepts
- Clean code isn't only a code that works
- a high-quality code is a reliable, maintenablecode.

## Single Responsible Priciple
### A class should have one, and only one, responsibility and reason to change.

## Open Closed Principle
### A class should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

## Liskov Substitution Principle
### Subtypes should be replaceable by their base types
### This principle force us to think twice before using interitance with our classes, as our classes shoudn't be extended only based on the fact they share something in common.
